      <p>
        Located on the rugged northern Black Sea coast, just 2 km south of the
        village of Kamen Bryag, the
        <strong>Yaylata National Archaeological Reserve</strong> is a stunning
        open-air museum where ancient history meets breathtaking nature. The
        reserve covers a seaside terrace separated from the sea by dramatic
        50–60 meter high cliffs, offering panoramic views of the water.

        Visitors can explore a fascinating "cave city" comprising 101 ancient
        dwellings dating back to the 5th millennium BC, alongside Thracian
        necropolises and the restored towers of an early Byzantine fortress from
        the 6th century AD. Beyond its history, Yaylata is famous for its
        natural beauty; it lies on the Via Pontica bird migration route and is
        blanketed with wild red peonies every spring.
