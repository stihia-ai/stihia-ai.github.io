    <h1>Visit Yaylata!</h1>
    <p>
      Located on the rugged northern Black Sea coast, just 2 km south of the
      village of Kamen Bryag, the
      <strong>Yaylata National Archaeological Reserve</strong> is a stunning
      open-air museum where ancient history meets breathtaking nature. The
      reserve covers a seaside terrace separated from the sea by dramatic 50–60
      meter high cliffs, offering panoramic views of the water.

      Visitors can explore a fascinating "cave city" comprising 101 ancient
      dwellings dating back to the 5th millennium BC, alongside Thracian
      necropolises and the restored towers of an early Byzantine fortress from
      the 6th century AD. Beyond its history, Yaylata is famous for its natural
      beauty; it lies on the Via Pontica bird migration route and is blanketed
      with wild red peonies every spring.

After the last digit, just stop. No need to write anything else.
